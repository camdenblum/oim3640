## What I learned today
Difference between agent and chat bot
Agent will do a task for you and chat bot will just answer 
Chat uses stuff that is outdated or more advanced
Def → creates a function
Pip → not best way to import a package
Version control - method of keeping track of changes to a file or gorup of files overtime, allowing users to access and revert to previous versions if needed 
How to set up a respotory in git hub
limiattions in using replit and Chat GPT to make an app


## Code/work I'm proud of (optional)

print('Hello, World!')


## Challenges I faced
There was no python file for the code for the app I designed in replit. I fumbled when setting up github and tried to correct the issue quickly which resulted in getting a bit behind and stressed in class. however, I was able to fix the solution and follow along by writing code in a doc to copy and paste in the software when set up.

## AI usage (if any)
Used replit to create a simple app to see when a person should wash theur dishes based on smell
Since replit didnt give python code, we also used Chat GPT to make the pytho code 

## Questions for next time

What is a happy medium for building an app between replit and Chat GPT?
