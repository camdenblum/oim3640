# Session 1(1/20) - [Introduction]

## What I learned today
I learned about the structure of the course and that, with the evolving AI atmosphere, it is very important to still be hands-on and learn, knowing what the code means, if AI helps. How to identify problems, even in day-to-day life, is crucial to knowing the importance of software. We learned that vibe coding is a very easy way to help start to code, but it comes with its limitations and challenges the longer you vibe. 

## Code/work I'm proud of (optional)

## Challenges I faced
Not related to classes, but just getting settled into classes and lowering the anxiety around a new, challenging course. I sat next to a friend to have good conversations before the class to act as a distraction to the stress to help settle in. I focused on how a main aspect of this class is to learn, not necessarily perfection, which helped limit stress.

## App idea
