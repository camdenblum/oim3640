# Session 6 (2/5) - []

## What I learned today
 #QUIZ WILL BE ON ALL EXAMPLES IN CLASS AND EXERCISES IN TEXTBOOK
    WILL HAVE TO CORRECT CODE/BUILD OFF OF IT
    EXPLAIN ERRORS

Parameters are local

for i in range(4):
#this says for whatever is in the body of the function, the for loop runs it 4 times. Can add equations to make them count up, down, and multiply to get a specific return. Refer to ch3 problems

for i in range(start, end, skip):

print(double(5))
#10 
print(double('5'))
5 5 

Use double quotes for strings if sentence has a apostorphe in it:
    "I'm fine" Is correct
    'I'm fine' Is Error

a = 5 --> assigns value to a
b = a --> assigns value a to value b
a = 10 --> assins value to a
print(b)
print(a)
5 10
Since a = 5 then b = a b will = 5 not 10. But since last line assigns a=10 print(a) will return 10

immutable means you cannot change, mutable means you can change

s.append - store multiple values to a variable 

def foo():
    message = "hello"
    x = 5
    return x

print(foo()) --> 5 (x=5 is a local variable within the function)
print(x) --> 10 (calling for x as a global variable, so x = 10)
print(message) --> Error (no message varibale defined in global)

def triangle(s, height):
    for i in range(1, height + 1): --> when building the triangle, the 1 starts writh one block in row i, then the +1 adds each block to the next row (height) in the triangle, repeat the process, 
        print(s * i)

triangle("+", 4)

def backwards_triangle(size):
    for i in range(size):
        print(" " * (size - i -1) + "#" * (i+1))
        #first section is saying taking the first row, then subtract one i then and extra one to get the declining indentations to get the flipped triangle. 
        #Then after the + it is adding an additional section of the triangle, which creates a visual of the triangle

        #by remoinng a space from the

## Code/work I'm proud of (optional)

## Challenges I faced

#im confused at why print(1) with this function will produce 1, 3, 5
for i in range(1, 6, 2):
    print(i)

#This code did not work saying that TypeError: string indices must be integers, not 'tuple'
#name = "ABCDEFGHIJK"

#name[0]

#name[1, 5, 2]

#When writing this code, I really struggled to include the spaces to build the backwards triangle and understading the "print(" " * (size - i -1) + "#" * (i+1))" line and why it produces the output
def backwards_triangle(size):
    for i in range(size):
        print(" " * (size - i -1) + "#" * (i+1))

backwards_triangle(5)
