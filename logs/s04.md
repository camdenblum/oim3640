# Session 4 (1/29)

## What I learned today

For terminal (command line) for navigation:
    cd folder - Change directory (go into folder)
    cd.. - go up one level
    dir - List files in current folder
    mkdir folder - Make a new folder
    pwd - Print working directory (whem am i?)

control enter - run block 
shift enter - move to next block 
alt enter - run block and make new block bellow

If code doesnt work, go into terminal and use > "cd code" to make it a folder, then run > python (codename.py)

press "d" twice deletes 

control c in termanal stops it 

"import this" in pythod interactive shell

In VS Code you have to type print even if you are just doing math.

Overall in the class I learned how to use quick commands to run promts and add or move from blocks. I also learned that you can either use the terminal in VS Code or Power shell but they essentailly do the same thing. Now when I read the chapters I feel like I will learn more by filling out the examples on my own rather than just reading them becasue when I read them on canvas they feel intuitive.

Apart from the work itself, I learned that I learn well in class if someone around me is struggling and I can try to help them. This makes me remember the sequence of steps to get an output stronger. Ex. The Steps to do certian action with a folder.

I struggled to import both math.cos and math.sin becasue only one would go through when I run 
math.cos
math.sin

## Code/work I'm proud of (optional)

# The radius is 5cm

r = 5
p = math.pi

#To calculate the volume:
volume = (4/3)*p*r**3

print('The Volume of the sphere is', volume, 'cubic cm')

## Challenges I faced

Initally i forgot to do cd code to run python Hello.world, so I was confused on why it wasnt working.

After I saved my work in Chapter 1 running the commands in jupyter website, it did not show up in my VS Code notebooks for chapter 1.

I was confused why my changes werent showing up in my VS Code notebook when I edited them on the juypeter website.

In the exercises I tried to assign each output a variable so when it asked for a ratio I could just do x/y, but I did not do it successfully.

I tried to make the anwsers have words with it, ex. seconds, km and so on, but everytime the word ends beneath the math. And the code may not be the most efficient.

In chapter 2 I didnt run the import math, math.pi so I would have an error code when I wrote:
print('The value of pi is approximately')
print(math.pi)
However after running the code before, it worked successfuly!

## AI usage (if any)

I used AI to help solve the second problem in chapter 2. I was struggling how to assign correct varibales using cos and sin.

## Questions for next time

Why would it be neccacry to launch the jupyter website to make edits when you can just do it straight in vs code?

How can I get words to show up sequentially (next) to a math equation?

How can i assign variables with just the number if it has a word with it?

Why cant you start a equation with a varaible? Or what am i doing wrong for it not to be a variable when I type it even when its defined? (cosx)**2+(sinx)**2+(cosx)**2
