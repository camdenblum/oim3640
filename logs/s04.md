## What I learned today

For terminal (command line) for navigation:
    cd folder - Change directory (go into folder)
    cd.. - go up one level
    dir - List files in current folder
    mkdir folder - Make a new folder
    pwd - Print working directory (whem am i?)

control enter - run block 
shift enter - move to next block 
alt enter - run block and make new block bellow

If code doesnt work, go into terminal and use > "cd code" to make it a folder, then run > python (codename.py)

press "d" twice deletes 

control c in termanal stops it 

"import this" in pythod interactive shell

In VS Code you have to type print even if you are just doing math.

Overall in the class I learned how to use quick commands to run promts and add or move from blocks. I also learned that you can either use the terminal in VS Code or Power shell but they essentailly do the same thing. Now when I read the chapters I feel like I will learn more by filling out the examples on my own rather than just reading them becasue when I read them on canvas they feel intuitive.

Apart from the work itself, I learned that I learn well in class if someone around me is struggling and I can try to help them. This makes me remember the sequence of steps to get an output stronger. Ex. The Steps to do certian action with a folder.

## Code/work I'm proud of (optional)

## Challenges I faced

Initally i forgot to do cd code to run python Hello.world, so I was confused on why it wasnt working.

After I saved my work in Chapter 1 running the commands in jupyter website, it did not show up in my VS Code notebooks for chapter 1.

I was confused why my changes werent showing up in my VS Code notebook when I edited them on the juypeter website.

## AI usage (if any)

## Questions for next time

Why would it be neccacry to launch the jupyter website to make edits when you can just do it straight in vs code?
