Mini Project #0

## My Project Proposal

**What I'm building:** I am building a app where users can play blackjack, roulette, and craps, and it will track their overall preformance both in win percentage and how much credit they gained or lossed. 

**Why I chose this:** Since I am a begginer at python, and enjoy the statistical element of these games, I think building an app where you could play them would be a great way to enjoy writing/learning python code. Granted it is does not solve a jarring problem, but since I know how the games already work I think using that logic and translating it into code would be a great starting point. 

**Core features:** 
 - It will allow users to select from a list of differnt games, (blackjack, roulette, craps)
 - It will track the users progress 
 - It will focus on user input during differnent play choices in each game 
 - It will consist of the differnt components within each game (cards, roulette numbers/colors, dice outcomes, for all games when player wins or loses)
 - Randomization will be one of the main core features to make the games fair and realistic
**What I don't know yet:** 
- I want to make the app more than just the basic display and allow for some more fun and unique features surrounding the app --> but I dont know what that will look like yet
- I know how to create random numbers, but I dont know how to make it so each round the card/number is removed 
- I dont know how to load differnt games from the starting point if the block of code for a specfic game is not fist in order.
