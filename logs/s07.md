# Session 7 (2/10) - []


## What I learned today

Though we discussed this before I forgot so its important to remember:
    bool evaluates as true or false

import turtle allows to make functions that can draw shapes

turtle.done() --> makes sure the turtle graphics wondow stays open until you close it
turtule.mainlop() -->   this is the same as turtule.done()but is more corss platform compatible


## Code/work I'm proud of (optional)

## Challenges I faced

The Quiz :( 

even though i typed the code exatly as writen in s07.py it was still not creating a spiral

## AI usage (if any)

## Questions for next time
