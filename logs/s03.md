## What I learned today
Setup:
I learned how to download and unzip a zip file into Git hub to the notebook section in my Git Hub Repository. 
Download --> Open --> select the correct folder --> import 

Chapter 1:
arithmetic operator is a symbol that represents an arithmetic computation
minus sign, -, is the operator that performs subtraction.
*, performs multiplication.
forward slash, /, performs division:
integers, which represent numbers with no fractional or decimal part, and
floating-point numbers, which represent integers and numbers with a decimal point.
// performs integer division (floor division)
** raises to x power
collection of operators and numbers is called an expression.
round function takes a floating-point number and rounds it off to the nearest integer.
abs does absolute value
must write abs(x)
syntax error means something is wrong
strings - sequence of letters
'hello' or "hello"
+ can add words together to form a sentence 
* repeat the same work x times
len shows length of a string
type(x) shows the value
the types int, float, and str can be used as functions
Natural languages are the languages people speak
Formal languages are languages that are designed by people for specific applications.
programming errors are called bugs and the process of tracking them down is called debugging.

Chapter 2:
variable is a name that refers to a value
assigment statement - n = 17
After creating a variable you can use it as an expression 
state diagram shows what state each of the variables is in (think of it as the variable’s state of mind).
underscores can be the only punctuation in a variable 
keyword is a special word used to specify the structure of a program
In order to use some Python features, you have to import them
module is a collection of variables and functions
To use a variable in a module, you have to use the dot operator     
pow raises one number to the power of a second number
math.pow(5, 2) = 15
To display more than one value, you can use the print function.
When you call a function, the expression in parenthesis is called an argument
# allows comments as seen why this is blue!

## Code/work I'm proud of (optional)

N/A

## Challenges I faced

I still struggle with knowing when committing and pushing is executed successfully. 

## AI usage (if any)
none 

## Questions for next time

Why are there multiple ways to achive the same output, ex. exponential math?
How often should we use comments? when is it too litte or too much?
