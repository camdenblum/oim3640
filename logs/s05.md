# Session 5 (2/3) - []

## What I learned today

learned that recursive creates an infiniate loop. We tested this by googling recursive and groundhog day. We also make a few lines of code to show the effect within the system.

Briefly introdused if else. If a certain thing happnes than another thing must occur.

setTimeout() - method of the Window interface sets a timer which executes a function or specified piece of code once the timer expires.

Indented code is the body of the code, set of instructions you want to define.
    Need to define the set of instrutctions in the body

Tripple quotes to begin and end to add comments within the body of a block of code: 
"""A function that prints 'groundhog day' wveer section indefiietly.""" = Doc String

I MUST WRITE DOC STRIING FOR EVERY BLOCK I WRITE 

Difference between int and float:
    They are both types of data within programing 
    int: is a whole number (integer)
    float: contains decimale points 
    The size of the data will be different 
        to check the size: 
            import sys
            sys.getsizeof()
What does 17 % 5 return? Why?
    Gives you the remainder after the integer devision
    moduel operator 

Control + I brings up a copiolot chatbot to ask questions to 

What variable is better and why? x vs student_count
student_count bec it is more descriptive on what this variable means
    variables should be meaningful 

print(x) will return None when trying to build off of that output
    SO WE MUST USE return(x) to prevent any errors - Refer to s05.py in class example

## Code/work I'm proud of (optional)
# a product would cost $100, how much tax do we pay

product = 100
tax = 0.0625

print("tax we pay", product * (1+tax))
# I wrote this a bit differntly than the example in class 

## Challenges I faced

I understand what doc strings are, but its still not clear to me 

With so many iterations in the in class tax exersizze, I forgot to add the mass and ny tax to the final parameters in the code so I was confused on why it did not run.
