## What I learned today

if score >= 60:
    print("Pass")
elif score >=  90:
    print("a")
else:
    print("fail")

If score = 95, Pass will be printed 

To fix this you change the order, python checks the first conidtition first, so the first one that passess will show that result.

if score >=  90:
    print("a")
elif score >= 60:
    print("Pass")
else:
    print("fail")


if there are two lines of "if" that requriments are met, both lines will show a result

def evaluate_score(score):
    if score >=  90:
        print("a")
    if score >= 60:
        print("Pass")
    else:
        print("fail")
score = int(input("enter your score")):
result = evaluate_score(score)
print(result)

If input 95 the first time the function produces "A" for 95 as the input the second time it will show the "95"

RETURN WILL IMMEDIETLY END THE FUNCTION AND RETURN THE FIRST MET CRITERIA 
PRINT WILL RUN BOTH MET CRITERIA 

def mystery(x):
    if x > 0 
        return "positive"
    print("done")

result = mystery(5)
print(result)

function wil run positive because return immediatly ends the function at that point once the criteria is met.

x = 15 
y = x > 10 and x = 20

what is the type and value of this expression?

y = True 
type is a boolian 

def main() - is where the major logic is code, entry point of all the code. 

precedence of python operators shows what operator to run first 

def check(n)
    if n % 2 == 0 
        if n % 3 = 0
            print("a")
        else:
            print("b")
    else:
        print("C")

check(8) Prints b becuase it is divisable by 2 but then not divisable by 3 so it goes to the else function after that line to print B
check(6) prints a becuase it passes the first line divisiable by 2 and then the second divisable by 3 so print a 

If you know the count, use for. If you are waiting for a condition use while.


## Code/work I'm proud of (optional)

## Challenges I faced

## AI usage (if any)

## Questions for next time

Unrealted to the lecture itself, but what are better study habits for the quiz/overall learning because i did not preform well enough on the quiz which is a reflaction of my learning.
