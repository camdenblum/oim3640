# Session 8 (2/19) - []

## What I learned today

if score >= 60:
    print("Pass")
elif score >=  90:
    print("a")
else:
    print("fail")

If score = 95, Pass will be printed 

To fix this you change the order, python checks the first conidtition first, so the first one that passess will show that result.

if score >=  90:
    print("a")
elif score >= 60:
    print("Pass")
else:
    print("fail")


if there are two lines of "if" that requriments are met, both lines will show a result

def evaluate_score(score):
    if score >=  90:
        print("a")
    if score >= 60:
        print("Pass")
    else:
        print("fail")
score = int(input("enter your score")):
result = evaluate_score(score)
print(result)

If input 95 the first time the function produces "A" for 95 as the input the second time it will show the "95"

RETURN WILL IMMEDIETLY END THE FUNCTION AND RETURN THE FIRST MET CRITERIA 
PRINT WILL RUN BOTH MET CRITERIA 

def mystery(x):
    if x > 0 
        return "positive"
    print("done")

result = mystery(5)
print(result)

function wil run positive because return immediatly ends the function at that point once the criteria is met.

x = 15 
y = x > 10 and x = 20

what is the type and value of this expression?

y = True 
type is a boolian 

def main() - is where the major logic is code, entry point of all the code. 

precedence of python operators shows what operator to run first 

def check(n)
    if n % 2 == 0 
        if n % 3 = 0
            print("a")
        else:
            print("b")
    else:
        print("C")

check(8) Prints b becuase it is divisable by 2 but then not divisable by 3 so it goes to the else function after that line to print B
check(6) prints a becuase it passes the first line divisiable by 2 and then the second divisable by 3 so print a 

If you know the count, use for. If you are waiting for a condition use while.

words = ["hello, "world", "target", "python"]
#for w in words:
        print('checkking:', w)
        if w == "target":
            print("Found it!\n")
            continue
        print(num) #prints odd numbers only

#continue - skip to the next itteration
#for num in range(10):
    if num % 2 ==0: 
        continue
    print(num) # prints odd numbers only

#print(f(10)) # prints all of the odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9)
    # of print is chnaged to return it will only produce (1)

# AI Code that I may use for mini project 



## Code/work I'm proud of (optional)

When we had the time at the end of the class to write our own code: I wrote this which was a good start to get myself in the right headspace on how the logic will flow for my mini project: 

while playing:
    player_card = random.randint(1, 11)
    dealer_card = random.randint(1, 11)

    print("You drew:", player_card)
    print("Dealer drew:", dealer_card)

    choice = input("Would you like to hit or stand?: ")
    if choice == "hit":
         player_card = player_card + random.randint(1, 11)
    if choice == "stand":
        for dealer_card in range <= 17:
            dealer_card = dealer_card + random.randint(1, 11)

    if player_card > dealer_card:
        print("You win!")
    else:
        print("You lose")

    choice = input("Play another hand? (y/n): ")
    if choice == "n":
        playing = False

## Challenges I faced

I think a issue I am running into during the classes, is when I follow along in class, the code seems logical, but when I am removed from the classroom it is confusing. Naturally something will make sense when it is explained, but this is a challenge I face when I review lessons. 

## AI usage (if any)

## Questions for next time

Unrealted to the lecture itself, but what are better study habits for the quiz/overall learning because i did not preform well enough on the quiz which is a reflaction of my learning.
