# Session 8 (2/12) - []

## What I learned today

Reenforced in the start of class that AI is very important to understand and use productivley in our day to day life

Introduced Mini Project 1

The name python comes from Guido van Rossum's favorite comedy show Monty Python

Python: The Doccumentary came out last year on how Guido created the languge 

0.1 + 0.2 wont give the completley correct result --> this happens becasue it rounds to nearest even number 

Functions help us: 
    Decomposition --> break big problems nto smaller, manageable parts
    Abstraction --> hide the messy details, focus on the inputs and outputs

Interface of a drone: input (commands) --> output (actions)

Abstraction: to use a drone you dont need to understand the inner mechanisms 
    Hide the inner details o fhow something works 
    focus on the inputs, outputs and result 
    Saves us from messy details 
    Desrive with function specs or docstrings

Decomposition:
    Break a big problem into smaller, self contained pieces, 
    each part can work on its own

In programing we split code into moduels of fucntions: 
    each part is self conained
    easier to manage and resuse 
    keeps oragnized and clear

Function is a resuable block of code

Key parts of a function:
    Name: how we call it
    parameters
    docstring
    body: code it runs
    return value: result it gives back

return value can be:
    used in expressions: total = area(5) = area(3)
    passed to other cubtions: print(area(5))
    stored in variables: a = area(5)

Internal Development:
    Step 1: start with skeleton 
    Step 2: add intermediate calc
    Step 3: complete the function 
    NOTE: refer to s08 slides for example of what code looks like

Boolean Function:
    Expressions rhat evaluate to True of False
    Logical operators combine conditions 

Conditional Statements"
    ORDER MATTERS - first matching condition wins
    elif and else are optional 
    each branch must be indented 



## Code/work I'm proud of (optional)

## Challenges I faced

When I run code it doesnt give the result within the terminal: ![alt text](image.png)
    MAKE SURE TO USE PRINT YOU GOOFBALL!!!!

s07.py didnt run becasue there were small mistakes from copying the code from class
    NOTE: MAKE SURE TO BE CARFUL NOT TO MISS ANY LINES OF CODE OR "()" OR ":"


## AI usage (if any)

## Questions for next time
