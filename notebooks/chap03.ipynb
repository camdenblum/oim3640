    "There are several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Creating a new function gives you an opportunity to name a group of\n",
    "    statements, which makes your program easier to read and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Functions can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code.\n",
    "    Later, if you make a change, you only have to make it in one place.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Dividing a long program into functions allows you to debug the parts\n",
    "    one at a time and then assemble them into a working whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Well-designed functions are often useful for many programs. Once you\n",

    "## Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging can be frustrating, but it is also challenging, interesting, and sometimes even fun.\n",
    "And it is one of the most important skills you can learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some ways debugging is like detective work.\n",
    "You are given clues and you have to infer the events that led to the\n",
    "results you see.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging is also like experimental science.\n",
    "Once you have an idea about what is going wrong, you modify your program and try again.\n",
    "If your hypothesis was correct, you can predict the result of the modification, and you take a step closer to a working program.\n",
    "If your hypothesis was wrong, you have to come up with a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some people, programming and debugging are the same thing; that is, programming is the process of gradually debugging a program until it does what you want.\n",
    "The idea is that you should start with a working program and make small modifications, debugging them as you go.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you find yourself spending a lot of time debugging, that is often a sign that you are writing too much code before you start tests.\n",
    "If you take smaller steps, you might find that you can move faster."
